## Summary
**Goal:** Build a dynamic portfolio website for a Salesforce Senior Engineer with AI assistant integration, content management system, and Salesforce CRM connectivity.

**Planned changes:**
- Create home page with dynamic introduction section (profile picture, name, title, bio)
- Implement achievements section with image uploads and descriptions
- Add contact form with Salesforce REST API integration for lead/contact creation
- Build blog section with post management (title, content, date, featured images)
- Integrate AI assistant chatbot (bottom right corner) with Salesforce Agentforce API, custom avatar/name, and animated greeting
- Develop comprehensive CMS for managing all content (profile, achievements, blog, AI settings, custom sections)
- Design vibrant, colorful, modern UI with animations and responsive layout

**User-visible outcome:** A fully functional portfolio website where visitors can view the professional profile, achievements, and blog posts, submit contact forms (stored in Salesforce), and interact with an AI assistant. The site owner can dynamically edit all content through an admin interface without touching code.
